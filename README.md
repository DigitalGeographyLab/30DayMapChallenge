This repository contains the source code and accompanying files for (some of) the maps submitted by the Digital Geography Lab to [@tjukanovt](https://github.com/tjukanovt)â€™s [*30 Day Map Challenge*](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge).

Going to fill with beautiful maps over the course of November 2021.
